![[Owen's Merchantile Council.png]]

The Orwennial Freeboast is ruled by the Merchantile Council, a group of wealthy and influential individuals who hold vast power and influence over the region. The Council is comprised of the most successful merchants, traders, and business owners, who use their wealth and influence to maintain their position at the top of the social and economic hierarchy. The Council makes all decisions regarding the policies and laws of the Freeboast, and its members hold ultimate authority over all other institutions within the region.

The Council operates through a complex system of committees and sub-councils, each responsible for a specific aspect of governance. Some members of the Council focus on financial and economic matters, while others specialize in security and military affairs. The Council is known for its ruthless efficiency, and its members are known to be cunning and conniving.

Seen by many as the pinnacle of the Rule of Coin, it is believed by many that if one simply does well enough, they might one day count themselves amongst its members, yet few ever see the top.
