![[Footburn Mines.png]]

The Footburn Mines are located in the southeast of the Orwennial Freeboast, and are a source of valuable resources for the region. The mines are set within the former volcanic caves, where indentured servants are tasked with the dangerous and grueling work of extracting precious metals and magic resonance crystals. The environment within the mines is harsh, with treacherous conditions and frequent cave-ins posing a constant threat to the workers. Despite these dangers, the Footburn Mines are a crucial source of wealth and power for the [[Orwen's Merchantile Council|Council]], and they are fiercely guarded to prevent theft and dissent. The indentured servants who work in the mines are subjected to long hours, hazardous conditions, and meager wages, with little hope of ever gaining their freedom. The Footburn Mines are a symbol of the exploitation and oppression that are rampant in the Orwennial Freeboast, where even the land itself is used as a means of control and profit.
