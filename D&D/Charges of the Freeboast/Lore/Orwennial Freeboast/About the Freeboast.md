The Orwennial Freeboast is a manifestation of the purest form of freedom: The ability to determine where you empty your own purse. It is a land untainted by the shackles of authority, where individuals are free to pursue their own self-interest and accumulate wealth without interference. The region's prosperity is derived from its position on the Sea of Plenty, which serves as a testament to the ingenuity and enterprise of its inhabitants.

The Orwennial Freeboast stands as a beacon of merit, rejecting the notions of laws, kings and any central authority that stifle the human spirit. It operates on the principle that value is subjective, and everything has a price that is determined by the market. This allows for a dynamic and ever-evolving economy, where success is determined by merit, and the only limit to wealth is the creativity and drive of the individual.

The Orwennial Freeboast is a shining example of what can be achieved when individuals are free to pursue their own interests and reap the rewards of their labor. It is a true celebration of the human spirit and the power of Coinism to drive progress and prosperity.

However, beneath the veneer of freedom and prosperity lies a more sinister reality. The Orwennial Freeboast is controlled by [[Orwen's Merchantile Council]], a powerful group that manipulates the economy to maintain their own wealth and power. Dissent is not tolerated, and anyone who dares to question the status quo is branded as a traitor and an agent of the former aristocracy.

The reality of life in the Orwennial Freeboast is that it is a society ruled by fear and oppression, where the only freedom is the freedom to serve the interests of the wealthy elite. The individualism that the Merchantile Council espouses is nothing but a guise to conceal their true motivations: to maintain their power and control over the masses. The Sea of Plenty, once a symbol of hope and prosperity, has become a symbol of exploitation and oppression, as the people of the region are forced to work to enrich the already wealthy and powerful.

In the Orwennial Freeboast, the branding of dissenters as traitors serves to not only silence opposition but also control the population through increased costs of essential goods and services. Dissenters eventually are forced to sell themselves into indentured servitude, working to the north in the army, fighting off the imperial armies of [[About the Empire|Middleholm Empire]], to the east in the [[Footburn Mines|Footburn]], or in the west in the [[Gulf of Plenty]].
