We're exploring the Emerald Grotto, racing another team to find an amulet. Everone was given a potion of water breathing, [[Frux - No√Ø]] and [[Aya Jabe]] spill the potion on the floor. 

Swimming through the grotto, Frux notices a shining piece of metal on the floor of a cavern and goes to get it, as they get attacked by a giant octopus. It grapples them, and [[Arleta Stolz - Jacob]] tries with Mage Hand to free Frux. The party fights it, stabbing it on all sides, quickly dispatching it.

After [[Andrea - James]] cleaves the octopus apart, Frux continues downwards, and find 57 silver pieces and a satchel that contains 8 unknown marble-sized pallets. The rest of the party pushes onwards, whilst Frux collects the treasure.

They come across a stream of harsh current, as well as a rock with a rune engraved in it. Arleta hits it with a hammer, and the stone chips, weakening the rune, and with another hit, the rock shatters, and the current subsides

The party enters what looks like a dead end, but Frux finds two hidden exits, one, leading towards an alcove where they find 3 Potions of Healing, the other, leading towards a cavern with a shark bearing the amulet they were looking for.

- [[Zarian - Jordan]] attempts to shove the dead shark he'd been carrying into its mouth, but the shark just swallows it
- Arleta follows up with a chaos bolt, striking it with a thundering orb, scorching the shark. 
- [[Ulm'rouha - Jonah]] attempts to hit it with his warhammer, but just barely misses
- Andrea charges in with her longsword, hitting it and attempting to shove the shark, though sadly it proves to be just a bit too big
- Scenting Zarian's wounds, the shark launches a frenzied attack on him, but Ulm'rouha intercepts it, taking the bite like a champ
- Frux throws their trident at it, hitting it, and the spirits swimming around them follow, chipping away at its skin. At the same time, long thorns shoot out towards it, some of them hitting, piercing its skin
- [[Leah - Joe]] cuts the rope the necklace is hanging from, and catches it
- Zarian attacks it with his Javelin, getting in a solid hit, jabbing into the shark's mouth who now lets go of all the shields and regurgitating the smaller shark Zarian had lodged into its mouth
- Arelta tosses a firebolt at it, scorching it
- Ulm'rouha shouts "DO THAT AGAIN" at Zarian and attempts to open the shark's mouth, and directs Zarian to hit it with a javelin again. Zarian reacts and stabs it again, getting in another good hit, shoving the spear back into the shark's mouth.
- Andrea goes at it with her longsword, smiting the shark on hit. The shark is now wet
- The shark looks pretty fucked up at this point, its thrashing about, and attempts to bite Leander. Though the initial bite makes contact, Arleta rolls back time, allowing the shark for a second, better bite. Ulm'rouha attempts to intercept it, and the shark chomps into him. It attempts to swim away, and everyone attempts to use this chance to jab it. Frux forgets how short their arms are, and sort of punches the water. Leander and Zarian, however, get in a few hits
- Frux catches their trident and goes in to stab the shark. On inpact, their kelplings dash at the shark, shoving it 15 feet into the wall. Frux suggests everyone retreats, they have the amulet, and can win just by returning, Arleta agrees.
- Leander seems to doubt whether or not he should retreat. He gived Andrea the necklace, and investigates the glowing silvery light deeper into the cave. He realises its night time and it could not possibly be daylight, and decides to hold his position, ready to strike at the shark if it were to chase
- Zarian throws his javelin at it, but sadly misses. 
- Arleta shoots magic missiles at the shark
- Ulm'rouha throws the speak he caught from Frux at the previous contest, hitting it, but the rusty spear does not seem to do much damage.
- Andrea, who has the necklace, touches Leander to the chest, heals him, and follows Frux and Arelta back into the cavern
- The shark tried to attack again, but Leander is ready to attack. He rages, but misses, when Arleta once again rolls back time for Leander to try again. This time, he hits, bringing the shark onto the brink of death. It attacks Ulm'rouha, who parries it with his shield, but still takes a significant jab. 
- Frux takes the necklace from Andrea, and dashes out of the cave, joking to not let the rest die.
- Leander swings at the shark with his greataxe, putting the shark out of its misery, and the thrashing shark swims its last swam. 

During its dying rage, the shark crashes into a stone column, crumbling down a wall, revealing a bright light. Aya lets out her trademark "WOOO!" at this, and Zarian starts decapitating the shark. Frux returns to have a peek at whats happening, accidentally making eye contact with Aya. Andrea approaches Aya, meeting her for the first time, and they introduce eachother and share some conversation about what's been happening. Andrea tells her Arleta is crazy strong with hammers. Aya's party looks kinda hammered. 

In the newly opened section of the cave, Zarian notices a giant beam of golden light, as well as a silver spear lodged into the shark. He pulls out the spear, and the shark stops glowing. Leander follows the beam of light, breaching the surface. The beam comes from a grove, with trees, opened to the air, covered in vines and crystals. In the centre, a pedestal with a golden amulet. He inspects the pedastal. It has writing along it, and Leander figures out that this shrine is dedicated to the [[Moonweaver, the Silver God in the Sky]]. He takes the amulet, the light fades, and the spirit of a kneeling woman appears instead. She holds her hands over her eyes, as if crying. She has three pairs of wings on her back. She asks: "Do you remember me?", as the floor falls away from beneath Leander. The party is emerged in a golden light, and they can feel themselves falling down, deeper and deeper, until they find themselves on the ocean floor, surrounded by kelp forests. Around the party, formless blue lights show up. They are coming as tears from the woman, and the party feels compelled to approach. Her crying seems to resonate with the ocean, and the ocean itself seems to weep. The kelp dies, and the woman speaks, angry, \[...]

The party awakes in the grove. Ayo's party seems to be attending to them and their wounds.  Her party did not seem to have experienced the same thing, but they seem very concerned. A new light source appears in the room: Leander, breathing fast, has a birthmark grow and spread along his face. Surrounding the party, are now more spectres. They appear to be whispering the same horrific phrases that were heard earlier. They don't seem to acknowledge anyone's existence, simply phase in and out of existence. 
Andrea concerns herself over Leander, who is clearly not OK, and potentially having some sort of arcane panic attack. She manages to anchor Leander back down to our realm, and the specters seem to slowly die away. 
Leander's eyes shoot open, he screams our Arleta's name, and puts his hand on his battleaxe, and seems to come down from his barbarian rage. 
Frux picks up the amulent and puts it in their bagpack using their trident, not touching it. They lead both parties out of the grotto, walking immediately back into the cave, asking everyone to discuss next steps. They suggest talking to [[Elder Colbu Kaz]] after the festivities, take out the [[Emerald Eye]], stride out of the grotto, facing the crowd. 

Frux licks one of the pallets. Its aggressively dry.
